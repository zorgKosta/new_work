XIX
This song is not for the living,
This song is for the dead.

With my face
Against the floor
I can’t see who knocked me out of the way.
I don’t want
To get back up,
But I have to, so it might as well be today.

Nothing appeals to me,
No one feels like me,
I’m too busy being calm
to disappear.
I’m in no shape
To be alone —
Contrary to the shit that you might hear.
